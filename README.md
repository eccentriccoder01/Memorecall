### üí° Core Features

* **Precise Countdown Functionality:** Users can set a target date and time using a `datetime-local` input, and the application accurately calculates and displays the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
* **Customizable Timer Names:** Each countdown can be given an optional, descriptive name, allowing users to easily identify their timers (e.g., "New Year's Eve").
* **Preset Timers:** For quick setups, the application provides preset buttons for common countdown durations like 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes, automatically populating the input fields.
* **Pause and Resume:** Users have the flexibility to pause and resume the currently displayed countdown timer.
* **Reset Functionality:** The main timer can be reset, clearing the display and stopping the countdown.
* **Multiple Active Timers:** Users can add and manage multiple countdowns simultaneously. These are displayed as "mini-timers" in a dedicated section, each showing its name and remaining time.
* **Timer Removal:** Individual mini-timers can be easily removed from the active timers list.
* **Completion Notification:** When a timer reaches zero, a prominent modal appears, accompanied by a sound notification, to alert the user.

### üé® User Interface & Experience

* **Dynamic Theme Selection:** Users can choose from four distinct color themes: Golden (default), Emerald, Crimson, and Sapphire. This dynamically changes the application's color scheme, including primary, secondary, accent, background, and text colors, along with glassmorphism effects and shadow colors.
* **Glassmorphism Design:** The UI elements like input fields, buttons, and display panels feature a modern glassmorphism effect with blurred backgrounds and semi-transparent borders, enhancing the premium feel.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on both desktop and mobile devices.
* **Interactive Background Animation:** Subtle floating orbs with gradient backgrounds, tied to the selected theme, animate in the background, adding a dynamic and visually appealing element.
* **Progress Ring Visualization:** The main timer display includes a circular progress ring that visually represents the elapsed time as a percentage of the total countdown duration.
* **Sound Control:** Users can toggle sound effects (e.g., completion alerts) on or off, with their preference being saved.
* **Persistent Settings:** Theme and sound preferences are saved locally in the browser, ensuring a consistent experience across sessions.
* **Urgency Effects:** As a countdown approaches completion (less than 1 minute), visual urgency effects are applied to the time values, changing their color and adding a pulsating animation.
* **Custom Animations:** Various elements incorporate smooth CSS animations for transitions, such as button hovers, theme changes, notifications, and modal displays.
* **Notifications:** Informative notifications appear for actions like starting a timer, pausing, resetting, or encountering errors.
* **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Inclusion of keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `Ctrl+Enter` to start, `Ctrl+Space` to pause, `Ctrl+R` to reset, `Escape` to close modal) enhances usability for power users.
